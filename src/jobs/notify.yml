  This job checks for flaky tests in the project and notifies a slack channel if
  any are found and have flaked more than the desired threshold. This command uses the circleci cache
  to prevent notifying slack more than once for the same flaky test.

  This job uses the following environment variables:
  - CIRCLE_TOKEN: CircleCI token for fetching flaky tests via API. (can also specify this via a parameter)
  - SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN: Slack token for posting messages to Slack. (see https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/slack)
  - SLACK_DEFAULT_CHANNEL: Default channel to post to. (can also specify this via a parameter)

executor: default

parameters:
  cache_break:
    type: string
    default: v0
    description: >
      A manual way to break the cache so notifications are set again. This could be helpful if you want to send
      flake notifications, for example, once per day by dynamically setting this to the current date e.g. "2020-01-01".
  channel:
    type: string
    default: $SLACK_DEFAULT_CHANNEL
    description: >
      Select which channel in which to post to.
      Channel name or ID will work.
      You may include a comma separated list of channels if you wish to post to multiple channels at once.
      You may also set the "SLACK_DEFAULT_CHANNEL" environment variable.
      Refer to https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/slack for more information.
  circle_token:
    type: env_var_name
    default: CIRCLE_TOKEN
    description: >
      The name of the env variable containing the CircleCI token for fetching flaky tests via API.
      If not specified, CIRCLE_TOKEN environment variable will be used.
      Please refer to this document how to generate it.
      https://circleci.com/docs/managing-api-tokens (requires a v2 token)
  project_slug:
    type: string
    default: ''
    description: >
      Example: gh/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs.
      Project slug in the form vcs-slug/org-name/repo-name.
      If not specified, current project's slug will be used.
  notify_threshold:
    type: integer
    default: 5
    description: >
      Threshold for notifying slack channel.
      If a test has flaked at least this many times, the channel will be notified.

steps:
  - notify:
      cache_break: <<parameters.cache_break>>
      channel: <<parameters.channel>>
      circle_token: <<parameters.circle_token>>
      notify_threshold: <<parameters.notify_threshold>>
      project_slug: <<parameters.project_slug>>
